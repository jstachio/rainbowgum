# Webapp benchmark findings

Notes from setting up and running the Spring Boot 4 REST benchmark suite in this directory
(Logback vs Log4j2 vs RainbowGum, one app per backend, shared controller + MDC filter, load
driven by `rainbowgum-benchmark-webapp-driver`). See `run-all.sh` to reproduce.

## Finding: `rainbowgum-jansi`'s console output was ~9x slower under load

**Symptom:** in an early run, the RainbowGum app measured ~1750 req/s / p50 4.7ms, against
~17800-18800 req/s / p50 0.37-0.40ms for Logback and Log4j2 at the same concurrency (8).
RainbowGum's raw (non-Spring) microbenchmark (`benchmark/rainbowgum-benchmark-rainbowgum`)
has never shown anything like this gap, so the cause had to be specific to what the Spring
Boot integration pulls in, not the core logging engine.

**Root cause:** `rainbowgum-spring-boot4-starter` depends on the `rainbowgum` umbrella
artifact, which transitively pulls in `rainbowgum-jansi` (`org.jline:jansi-core`) at
runtime. That module wraps `System.out` in a jansi `AnsiOutputStream` for colored console
output. Confirmed via JFR (`jcmd <pid> JFR.dump`, then
`jfr print --events jdk.FileWrite`) that individual log writes were going through
`org.jline.jansi.io.AnsiOutputStream.write(int)` **one byte at a time**, each call costing
2.5-9ms:

```
jdk.FileWrite {
  duration = 8.74 ms
  bytesWritten = 1 byte
  eventThread = "http-nio-8080-exec-5"
  stackTrace = [
    java.io.FilterOutputStream.write(int) line: 89
    org.jline.jansi.io.AnsiOutputStream.write(int) line: 164
    java.io.FilterOutputStream.write(byte[], int, int) line: 139
    java.io.PrintStream.write(byte[], int, int) line: 536
    io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogOutput$AbstractOutputStreamOutput.write(...) line: 439
    ...
  ]
}
```

A single one of these blocking single-byte writes per request was enough to account for
the entire per-request latency gap. The raw microbenchmark never sees this because it
depends only on `rainbowgum-slf4j`, not the `rainbowgum` umbrella artifact, so
`rainbowgum-jansi` was never on its classpath there.

**Fix applied here:** excluded `io.jstach.rainbowgum:rainbowgum-jansi` from
`rainbowgum-spring-boot4-starter` in `rainbowgum-benchmark-webapp-rainbowgum/pom.xml`. This
also matches Adam's plan to stop pulling jansi in by default going forward, since it's a
native dependency. After the exclusion, RainbowGum lands in the same ballpark as Logback
and Log4j2 (see results below) - actually with the lowest RSS of the three.

**Follow-up worth considering:** independent of this benchmark, `AnsiOutputStream.write()`
lacking a bulk `write(byte[], int, int)` fast path (falling back to per-byte iteration) is a
real perf trap for any real app that pulls in the full `rainbowgum` artifact with console
output enabled - not just this benchmark. Since jansi is being dropped from the default set
of dependencies anyway, this is probably moot, but noting it here in case that plan changes.

**Is this fixed upstream?** No. Checked both the exact jar in use (`org.jline:jansi-core:4.3.1`,
also the latest on Maven Central, decompiled locally) and the current `master` of
[jline/jline3](https://github.com/jline/jline3/blob/master/jansi-core/src/main/java/org/jline/jansi/io/AnsiOutputStream.java)
on GitHub: `AnsiOutputStream` still only overrides `write(int)`, never `write(byte[], int, int)`,
so it inherits `FilterOutputStream`'s byte-at-a-time default unconditionally. It does now have
a proper `AnsiType` enum (`Native`/`VirtualTerminal`/`Emulation`/`Redirected`/`Unsupported`) that
correctly detects when a terminal understands ANSI natively - but that field is only consulted
in `uninstall()` (whether to emit a reset code), never to skip the per-byte parse even when the
type is `Native` and there's nothing to strip or emulate. No open upstream issue found tracking
this specifically (two related closed issues, #137 and #143 on `jline/jline3`, are about
Windows console attribute-call batching from 2017, not this).

**How do Logback/Log4j2 avoid this?** They don't use jansi at all for Spring Boot's default
colored console output - confirmed both apps' dependency trees have zero `org.jline`/
`org.fusesource.jansi` artifacts. Their `%clr` pattern converters go through Spring Boot's own
`org.springframework.boot.ansi.AnsiOutput` (decompiled and confirmed: `toString(Object...)`
just appends literal ANSI escape bytes into a `StringBuilder`), so the escape codes are just
ordinary characters in the formatted line by the time it reaches the (buffered) output stream -
no stream-level ANSI processor, no per-byte parsing, no overhead.

## Latest run

Short validation-length runs (`WARMUP_SECONDS=3 DURATION_SECONDS=8 CONCURRENCY=8`), single
machine, single trial each - useful for sanity-checking the harness and the jansi fix above,
**not** a final/rigorous benchmark result (no repeated trials, no longer duration, no higher
concurrency). Re-run with the defaults (10s warmup / 30s duration / 50 concurrency, or
higher) for anything meant to be load-bearing.
