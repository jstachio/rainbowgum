<div class="js-toc-content">

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>


First step is to add <a href="#installation">Rainbow Gum as a dependency</a>. 
<p>
Second if you are not familiar with logging in the Java ecosystem please refer to
the excellent <a href="https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html">Logging facade SLF4J</a> documentation
particularly the <a href="https://www.slf4j.org/apidocs-2.1.0/org/slf4j/Logger.html">logger API</a>
and what logging Levels are. Logging levels are and how dotted logger names inherit levels is covered in
 the JDKs logging facade {@link java.lang.System.Logger.Level} as well as 
 <a href="https://logback.qos.ch/manual/architecture.html#effectiveLevel">Logback effective level</a>
 which Rainbow Gum follows.

</p>
The third step is to configure. Most configuration is just configuring logger names to levels, output, and formatting. 
We will cover the two major ways to do this in the following two sub sections.


<h3 id="simple_example">Using System properties</h3>

Assuming we have <a href="#installation">installed RainbowGum as a dependency</a> a simple configuration example using System Properties is below:

{@snippet :
  java \
  -Dlogging.appender.console.encoder=pattern \ 
  -Dlogging.encoder.console.pattern="[%thread] %-5level %logger{15} - %msg%n" \
  -Dlogging.level.com.myapp=DEBUG \
  myapp.jar 
}

What happens with the above is Rainbow Gum will load its default Rainbow Gum via the service loader and use the properties to configure
its builders. Unfortunately System properties on the command line can be rather tedious but luckily you
can plugin in your own properties system easily.

<h3 id="simple_example_builder">Using RainbowGum Builders</h3>

For organizations that have many projects it is recommended to use the programmatic builder approach and make a standardized jar (module)
shared between all your projects so that logging configuration is consistent.

Assuming we have <a href="#installation">installed RainbowGum as a dependency</a> a simple configuration example using
Java directly and the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} is below. 

{@snippet class="snippets.GettingStartedExample" region="gettingStarted" }

{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.spi.RainbowGumServiceProvider} has additional documentation on how to register
a service loader aware jar.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

Rainbow Gum is a JDK 21+ opinionated SLF4J implementation that aims to be easier to use
while leveraging newer JDK technology.

Rainbow Gum unlike Logback or Log4J (2) does not offer as much flexibility but is simpler
and has less overhead.

The <a href="https://github.com/jstachio/rainbowgum">readme in the Rainbow Gum project</a> 
discusses more extensively on the opinionated design and philosophy.

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/">Java 21 or greater</a></li>
  <li>A build system that supports running the Java compiler annotation processor</li>

The only module needed during runtime is  
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html">
  <code>java.base</code>
</a>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

Currently Rainbow Gum does not provide support for:

<ul>
  <li>External config - by design you will need to bring your own configuration lib or just use env/system properties.</li>
  <li>Rolling of log files. Will be added in the future.</li>
  <li>{@linkplain org.slf4j.Marker SLF4J Marker} support -  libraries and application rarely use it compared to MDC. </li>
 </ul>

 If any of these limitations (or others not listed) are a show stopper please let us know by filing an issue.
 Particularly Markers. If you are using Markers we would like to hear from you.

<h2 id="how_it_works">How it works</h2>

Most users will use Rainbow Gum through a logging facade such as SLF4J and the only interaction with
Rainbow Gum is configuration of output and formatting. Rainbow Gum provides three ways to configure
out of the box:

<ul>
  <li>Programmatic Java configuration using builders.</li>
  <li>Simple String key/value properties often derived from System properties / env variables</li>
  <li>Dependency driven configuration where including a jar as dependency changes behavior automatically</li>
</ul>

In practice many will use a mixture of all three styles. Rainbow Gum uses the Service Loader to load "default" configurations. 
Other than logger levels most configuration is simply choosing which jars to be included at runtime and providing some
simple properties.


<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

Rainbow Gum's design has many superficial similarities to Logback, Log4j2, and Reload4j in that
there are Appenders and Encoders as well as how log levels are inherited but most of Rainbow Gum's design
is <em>very different</em>!

<p>
  The key difference in Rainbow Gum is that once configured and initialized the logging system is locked in and
  cannot be changed. Certain parts of the system can be changed at runtime but require opt-in which includes changing
  levels of logger names.
</p>
<p>
  Another major difference is that Rainbow Gum is highly modularized, immutable and componentized. In other frameworks
  OOP inheritance is heavily abused and riddled with state management. Furthermore there are components that
  have too much responsibility which is the case with Appenders in Logback or "Managers" in Log4j2.
  Furthermore Rainbow Gum <strong>uses zero reflection</strong> other than the Service Loader and follows the builder pattern
  extensively to separate configuration from immutable runtime components. Almost all components have
  a builder to programmatically configure and the builders can take flat string key values as configuration. 
  The other logging frameworks use an enormous amount of reflection which slows initialization time.
  <em>(While the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} is technically reflection it is GraalVM native friendly and
    is the preferred way for pluggable components in modern JDKs.)
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The results of the above choices make Rainbow Gum far lighter than logback, log4j2, and reload4j particularly
  in initialization time as well as security surface area.
</p>

<strong>The key components expressed in the flow of log events is as follows:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Logging Facade (SLF4J)</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.RainbowGum}</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogRouter}</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogPublisher}</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogAppender}</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEncoder}</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogOutput}</li>
</ol>

In the next sections we will cover  
<a href="#config">Config</a>, 
<a href="#publishers">Publishers</a>, 
<a href="#appenders">Appenders</a>, 
<a href="#encoders">Encoders</a>,
and 
<a href="#outputs">Outputs</a>.

For most <a href="#level_resolvers">level resolving</a>, <a href="#formatters">formatters</a> (which are simplified encoders),
and <a href="outputs">Outputs</a> are the main points of interest in customizing and configuring.

<h2 id="config">Config</h2>

A defining characteristic of Rainbow Gum is that it does not have a special configuration format
like Logback, Log4j2, and Reload4j (all three use XML as the default). The expectation
is that for simple configuration {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties simple properties interface} analogous to 
<code>Function&lt;String,String&gt;</code> is good enough. For more complicated configuration
programmatic configuration using the builders and service loader should be used.
<p>
  For implementers of plugins {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogConfig } allows registering of services
  and plugins (it also contains the global {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties} ) however
  most users will not need to know about it. For those coming from Logback
  {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogConfig } is analogous to what Logback calls "Context".
</p>

<p>
Rainbow Gum out of the box uses System properties for {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties}
but an optional module {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.avaje/ } will allow using <a href="https://avaje.io/config/">Avaje Config</a>
as the properties provider. Other configuration systems will be added in the future but an 
important requirement is that these systems do not do any logging or if they do allow it to be
turned off, intercepted or blocked.

<strong>
  IMPORTANT: Rainbow Gum core does not do any interpolation of property values!
  That is the responsibility of the {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties}
  backing implementation and the values retrieved should already be interpolated.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong>
  <em>
    Throughout the documentation {@link java.util.Properties} and {@link java.net.URI} syntax is used to express
    configurable properties but it is a not a requirement and 
    your configuration system may have a different format like YAML or JSON.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
A listing of property patterns that are used out of the box is discussed in {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties}.

A general pattern is:

{@snippet lang=properties :
logging.{componentType}.{name}.{subComponent}=URI
logging.{subComponent}.{name}.{propertyName}=someStringThatIsConverted
}

An interpolated key (note key not value) example might be:

{@snippet lang=properties :
logging.appender.example.encoder=gelf
logging.encoder.example.prettyPrint=true
}

<em>
  The astute might notice that "gelf" does not look like a URI.
  It is but URIs missing schemes like the above get normalized so
  that the path is used as the scheme.
  Thus <code>gelf</code> is actually <code>gelf:///</code>
</em>

Because the first property is a URI one can do:

{@snippet lang=properties :
logging.appender.example.encoder=gelf:///?prettyPrint=true
}

URIs play an important part for component provision as the  {@link java.net.URI#getScheme() URI scheme}
is used for plugin lookup as well as single line configuration. This follows  
<a href="https://12factor.net/">12 factor</a> recommendation of resources and configuration.

</p>

<h3 id="config_change">Config Change during runtime</h3>

While most of the logging components in Rainbow Gum are immutable and cannot be changed during runtime there are some
exceptions including custom components.
<p>
  A supporting configuration system (a LogProperties provider) can notify that there has been a change
  by using the {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogConfig#changePublisher() Change Publisher}.
  This is how level resolving changes can be published.
</p>
<p>
  Config change is by default off even on supporting configuration systems and can only be enabled by setting 
  {@value io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties#GLOBAL_CHANGE_PROPERTY} to true.
</p>

<h2 id="router">Router</h2>

A Router has a {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LevelResolver} and a {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogPublisher Publisher}.
A Level Resolver takes a logger name and produces a {@link java.lang.System.Logger.Level level}.
The logging facade implementation than decides based on the level whether or not to construct an event.
It then passes the event to the router which in turn uses the publisher to schedule the event.

For those familiar with other logging frameworks 
<strong>Rainbow Gum has no actual concept of named "Loggers"</strong> but a route from a router is the closest analog.

<p>
  When configuring routers you are configuring
  {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LevelResolver Level Resolvers} which are logger names to levels,
  which publisher to use and which appenders should be assocated with the publisher. 
  We call this configuration a "route". As discussed later on
  a publisher has appenders and appenders have outputs thus 
  an important consequnce of this is if you want outputs to have different level thresholds
  (e.g. a debug.log and an error.log) you will need multiple routers. 
</p>

Example configuring router with properties using {@value io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties#ROUTE_PREFIX}
with name set to "<code>example</code>".

{@snippet lang=properties :
logging.routes=example
logging.route.example.appenders=appender1,appender2
logging.route.example.publisher=async
logging.route.example.level.com.mycompany=DEBUG
}

If {@value io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties#ROUTES_PROPERTY} is not set the route
name is assumed to be {@value io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogRouter.Router#DEFAULT_ROUTER_NAME}.
Notice that routes can contain their own level configuration and thus a route is a way
to group appenders with the same level resolving.

<h3 id="level_resolvers">Level Resolvers</h3>

As mentioned previously routers have a level resolver. A level resolver simply resolves
the {@linkplain java.lang.System.Logger.Level level} (an enum) from a logger name (String).
Because of {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LevelResolver} functional interface we can chain them
with <em>fallbacks</em>. An important fallback level resolver that almost all routers use
is the global level resolver. These levels can be configured with 
{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties properties} where logger names prefixed with 
{@value io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties#LEVEL_PREFIX} as the key and the level as the value.
Below is an example:

{@snippet lang=properties :
logging.level.com.mycompany.stuff=DEBUG
logging.level.com.mycompany=INFO
logging.level=ERROR
}

Although not required most level resolvers including the global follow an inheritance or prefix model where 
<code>com.mycompany.stuff.foo</code> will resolve to <code>DEBUG</code>
and <code>com.mycompany.bar</code> will resolve to <code>INFO</code>
and anything not prefixed with <code>com.mycompany</code> will resolve to <code>ERROR</code>.
<p>
  An important consideration is that Rainbow Gum
  <strong>
    by default assumes Level Resolvers are cached or static and will never change.
  </strong>
  This is a critical feature of Rainbow Gum as it <em>allows facade loggers like in SLF4J to be 
  lower overhead than almost all other logging frameworks!</em>
  That being said RainbowGum allows levels to be changed if the backing configuration framework
  supports reloading and the logger name is allowed to be changed.
</p>

Below is an example of configuring to allow <em>"changing" loggers</em>

{@snippet lang=properties :
logging.global.change=true          # this is required to turn on level changing. 
logging.change.com.mycompany=level  # only logger names starting with com.mycompany can have their levels changed.
}

<h3 id="caller_info">Caller Information</h3>

Somewhat related to level resolvers and config change is how to enable {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEvent#callerOrNull() caller info}.
{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEvent.Caller} has stack trace like information on where the logging call was made.
It is incredibly slow so like changing loggers it must be enabled and you can enable it with logger name inheritance
so not all loggers will be slow.

Below is an example of configuring to allow <em>"changing" loggers with <strong>caller info</strong></em>:

{@snippet lang=properties :
logging.global.change=true               # this is required to turn on level changing. 
logging.change.com.mycompany=caller      # only logger names starting with com.mycompany will have caller info
}

Caller info can be disabled dynamically with supporting configuration systems just like level changing.

Note that {@value io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties#CHANGE_PREFIX} is a comma separated list of 
{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogConfig.ChangePublisher.ChangeType} however caller info will automatically allow
the logger to change levels as well.

<h2 id="publishers">Publishers</h2>

A {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogPublisher} schedules delivery of a {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEvent} to a group of 
Appenders. Publishers come in two types:

<ol>
  <li>{@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogPublisher.SyncLogPublisher synchronous} - the default</li>
  <li>{@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogPublisher.AsyncLogPublisher asynchronous}</li> 
</ol> 

An appender should only
belong to one publisher. In other logging frameworks like Logback and Reload4J this responsibility is handled
by an Appender but Rainbow Gum separates this responsibility out.
<p>
An example configuring a route named "example" to use the default async publisher:
</p>

{@snippet lang=properties :
logging.route.example.publisher=async
logging.publisher.example.bufferSize=1024
}

Using an async publisher is a complicated topic with many caveats one of them being what to do if
the buffer is full. Rainbow Gum's default async publisher is a simple blocking queue implementation
that has a single consumer thread and will block producing threads if the queue is full.
The consumer thread simple iterates over the appenders pushing to each one. This loosely follows the
single writer principle. In the future
particularly with virtual threads more sophisticated async publishers might be offered
that might fan-out and other exotic strategies.
<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you want some appenders to be async and others sync you just create multiple routes. 
</p>

<h2 id="appenders">Appenders</h2>

An {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogAppender appender} contains an {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEncoder Encoder} 
and an {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogOutput Output}.
Unlike other logging frameworks it is rare to have custom Appenders as most of the work is done by the encoder and output.
That is an appender can be mostly thought of as a tuple of encoder and output.

<h2 id="encoders">Encoders</h2>

Encoders encode an event into binary. Because most encoding is text based RainbowGum has the concept of 
{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogFormatter} which can be turned into an Encoder and is covered 
in the next section. However there are scenarios where generating bytes directly is desirable.
<p>
  Rainbow Gum JSON encoder module {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.json/ } has efficient JSON encoders.
  <em>
    They are encoders instead of formatters (which are covered next) because writting JSON as bytes is more efficient.
  </em>
</p>
Configuring an {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties#APPENDER_ENCODER_PROPERTY appenders encoder with properties}
looks something like:

{@snippet lang=properties :
logging.appenders=myappender
logging.appender.myappender.encoder=gelf
logging.encoder.myappender.prettyPrint=true
}

The above will use the GELF JSON encoder and configure it to pretty print.
<p>
Encoders should have a builder as well to configure programmatically
and the builders javadoc has the string properties that can configure it.
</p>

Here are some of the supported encoders (not a complete listing):

<ul>
  <li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.json.encoder.GelfEncoderBuilder}</li>
  <li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.pattern.format.PatternEncoderBuilder}</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="formatters">Formatters</h3>

Formatting of log events as textual data is so common that Rainbow Gum has special support for that with
{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogFormatter}. While formatters can at high-level be considered
an encoder for technical API reasons they are not. However any formatter can be converted to an
encoder with {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEncoder#of(io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogFormatter)}. 

<h4 id="pattern">Pattern Formatter</h4>

  For those coming from Logback or Log4j2 
  Rainbow Gum has an {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.pattern/ optional module} for 
  <a href="https://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ClassicPatternLayout">Logback style based pattern</a> formatters. 
  This allows describing an output format using 
  <code>String.format</code> percent style syntax. Rainbow Gum implements most of the builtin Logback
  pattern keywords with far less overhead. 
  <p>
Like Logback you can even add your own pattern keywords which is covered in {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.pattern/ } module.
  </p>
  <strong>The pattern module is pulled in by default with the aggregate rainbow gum dependency.</strong> 
<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>If you plan on using the <strong>color </strong> pattern keywords it is generally a good idea (for now) to use
    the {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.jansi/ } module which is covered next. Regardless ANSI escape can be
    globally disabled by setting {@value io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties#GLOBAL_ANSI_DISABLE_PROPERTY} to
    <code>true</code> which will disable Jansi and the <em>default</em> pattern formatter from omitting ANSI escape sequences.
  </em>
</p>

<h4 id="jansi">JAnsi support</h4>
<p>
  Rainbow Gum also has support for proper cross platform {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.jansi/ ANSI output with JAnsi through an optional module}.
  Unlike other frameworks where this is detected with reflection Rainbow Gum uses the 
  Service Loader which is GraalVM native friendly.
</p>
  <strong>Why is JAnsi desirable?</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Support stripping ANSI characters on piping out which is desirable if you only use the console for output which
      is often the case for kubernetes and other microservices.
    </li>
    <li>
      Windows color output support.
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong>
  <em>
    <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8307341">Future versions of the JDK may require command line arguments</a> 
    for using jars packaged with native libraries. Given that Rainbow Gum favors security
    we strongly agree with the draft JEP and are exploring other options for the future.
  </em>
</p>
Jansi can be disabled with {@value io.jstach.rainbowgum.jansi.JAnsiConfigurator#JANSI_DISABLE}
or {@value io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties#GLOBAL_ANSI_DISABLE_PROPERTY} boolean properties.
<p>
  A major reason to disable Jansi is because it may <em>accidentally strip ANSI escape characters for terminals that
  do support ANSI but Jansi cannot determine they do</em>. The most notable case of this problem are IDEs particularly
  <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-132822"><strong>IntelliJ</strong></a>. 
</p>

<h2 id="outputs">Outputs</h2>

{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogOutput} do the actual work of outputting an event.

Configuring an {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties#APPENDER_OUTPUT_PROPERTY appenders output with properties}
looks something like:

{@snippet lang=properties :
  logging.appenders=myappender
  logging.appender.myappender.output=stdout
}

One caveat with file support output via URI is if you need to output to a file in the current working directory
the URI should be prefixed with <code>./</code>.

{@snippet lang=properties :
  logging.appenders=myappender
  # logging.appender.myappender.output=app.log this is wrong.
  logging.appender.myappender.output=./app.log
}

The reason is that Rainbow Gum will think <code>app.log</code> is a URI scheme if it is not prefixed.
Of course fully qualified file URI are supported as well like: <code>file:///./app.log</code>.
For Spring Boot compatibility {@value io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties#FILE_PROPERTY} is also supported
if custom routers and appenders are not configured.

<p>
Here are some of the supported outputs (not a complete listing):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>stdout and stderr</li>
  <li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.output.FileOutputBuilder} with URI scheme of "file"</li>
  <li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.rabbitmq.RabbitMQOutputBuilder} with URI scheme of "amqp"</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="filter">Filtering</h2>

Like logback Rainbow Gum provides two types of filtering through functional composition:

<ol>
  <li>{@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogRouter.Router.RouterFactory#of(Function) router based filtering} 
    - similar to logbacks normal filters.</li>
  <li>{@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.slf4j.spi.LoggerDecoratorService SLF4J based filtering} 
    - similar to <a href="https://logback.qos.ch/manual/filters.html#TurboFilter">logback Turbo Filters</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="router_filter">Event based Filtering</h3>

Unfortunately at this time router based filtering is not configurable through properties and can only be
added using {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.RainbowGum.Builder Rainbow Gum builder}
and composition has to be done manually.
<p>

  An example using router based filtering:

{@snippet class="snippets.FilteringExample" region="filteringExample" }

The above creates a custom {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogRouter.Router}
with a function. 

<em>
Event based filtering is still based on the invariants
of level resolvers not changing (unless they are configured to be dynamic) so
not all events are delivered if the level resolved does not not allow it!
</em>
A work around is to adjust the levels of the router so that it does get
all events desired and is why filtering is associated with routing.
<strong>Unfortunately this can be inefficient as the event always has to be created</strong>
so if performance matters consider using <a href="#slf4j_filter">SLF4J based filtering</a>.

</p>

<h3 id="slf4j_filter">SLF4J based filtering</h3>

{@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.slf4j.spi.LoggerDecoratorService SLF4J based filtering} is
not simple filtering but rather decorating of the SLF4J loggers somewhat akin to Servlet filtering.
Rainbow Gum hands off its generated SLF4J logger to you and you can decorate or even disregard
it and provide your own implementation. This is extremely powerful and efficient but requires more work.
There is not really an analog in Logback or Log4j but as usual <em>with great power comes great responsibility</em>!
<p>
These filters are usually loaded with the ServiceLoader so manually using the Rainbow Gum builder is not required
like router based filtering.
</p>


<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

For most simply including the dependency <code>io.jstach.rainbowgum:rainbowgum</code>
is enough. That dependency will transitively pull in the most commonly used modules.
For a more minimal setup (total application size in terms of classes)
<code>{@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum/ io.jstach.rainbowgum:rainbowgum-core}</code>
and <code>{@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.slf4j/ io.jstach.rainbowgum:rainbowgum-slf4j}</code> 
(if using SLF4J)
should be used.

<h3 id="maven">Maven</h3>

{@snippet lang=xml :
<properties>
    <rainbowgum.version>_VERSION_</rainbowgum.version>
</properties>
...
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.jstach.rainbowgum</groupId>

        <version>${rainbowgum.version}</version>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
}


If you plan on configuring Rainbow Gum programmatically you will need to make a module and create a
service loader registration. In that case you will want the dependency like:

{@snippet lang=xml :
<properties>
    <rainbowgum.version>_VERSION_</rainbowgum.version>
</properties>
...
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.jstach.rainbowgum</groupId>
        <artifactId>rainbowgum-core</artifactId>
        <version>${rainbowgum.version}</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
}

<h3 id="3.2">Gradle</h3>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">

</pre>


If you plan on configuring Rainbow Gum programmatically you will need to make a module and create a

<li>{@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.slf4j.spi.LoggerDecoratorService Decorating loggers}</li>
<li>{@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEvent.Caller Caller Information}</li>
</ul>
However there is currently no {@link org.slf4j.Marker} support. 
<p>
Rainbow Gum supports key value pairs
in {@link org.slf4j.spi.LoggingEventBuilder} by overlaying on top
of the current MDC at the time the event is constructed and put into the
{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEvent#keyValues() events key values}.
The value parameter in 
{@link org.slf4j.spi.LoggingEventBuilder#addKeyValue(String,Object)} are
converted to {@link java.lang.String} immediately as only String values are
supported at this time.
<p>
Rainbow Gum SLF4J implementation is unique in that it has 
two special implementation of loggers:
<ul>
<li>Level Logger - logger based on level threshold and <em>can never change</em>!</li>
<li>Changing Logger - level and other configuration <em>can change</em>.</li>
</ul>
Other logging implementations like Logback by default use something analogous to changing loggers
which require a constant check if the level threshold has changed.
Level loggers do not need to do that check. Unless 
{@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogConfig.ChangePublisher changing loggers is turned on} 
by default Level Loggers are used which are close to zero cost for discarding events.

<h3 id="system_logger">java.lang.System.Logger and java.util.logging</h3>

Rainbow Gum {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.jdk/} module provides special integration and adapters for the builtin JDK logging facilities.
The impetus for this is these logging facilities can be used early in the JDK boot processes well before
logging has fully initialized. The default rainbow gum dependency has this integration as a transitive dependency.

<p>
The integration will make sure that neither the System.Logger or java.util.logging initialize
Rainbow Gum too early by queueing the events. When a Rainbow Gum initializes and 
{@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.RainbowGum#set(Supplier) set as global} the events will be replayed.
If the events level are equal to {@link java.lang.System.Logger.Level#ERROR} and a normal Rainbow Gum has not been bound
the messages will be printed to <code>System.err</code>. 
The idea is something catastrophic has happened that will probably cause Rainbow Gum to never load and thus never replay the events
and you will not be able to figure out what happened otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  SLF4J does 
  <a href="https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#jep264">provide an adapter/bridge for the System.Logger (org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk-platform-logging)</a> 
  but its use may cause Rainbow Gum to initialize
  too early. <strong>However that maybe desirable if</strong>:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are sure that Rainbow Gum can initialize early</li>
    <li>Your application uses System.Logger 
      (the SLF4J adapter will initialize Rainbow Gum on System.Logger usage if using {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.slf4j/ })
    </li>
  </ul>
  In the future Rainbow Gum may include a System.Logger provider module that does eager initialization. 
<p>
  <em>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong>
    While the JDK System.Logger is good for low level libraries that rarely log 
    it's API (and Rainbow Gum implementation) is not designed for performance.
    For applications and frameworks that do a lot of logging the SLF4J facade is the preferred choice.

<h3 id="springframework">Spring Boot</h3>

<p>
Spring Boot allows configuration through simple properties for logging that tries to be logging framework agnostic.
How this works is Spring Boot configures the logging framework from its own set of properties.
There is a shocking amount of code Spring Boot requires to do this for Logback and Log4J2
because both of those frameworks were not designed well for programmatic configuration.
</p>

<p>
Rainbow Gum at the moment does not require special integration because it largely follows
the Spring Boot property patterns.

For example configuring levels to logger name with properties in Spring Boot is exactly
the same as it is in Rainbow Gum:

{@snippet lang=properties :
logging.level.com.mypackage=INFO
}

</p>

<p>
At some point Spring Boot will likely diverge enough on its property keys that
special integration will be needed. Rainbow Gum will have a solution for that 
in the future.
</p>



<h3 id="plugin_guide">Extension development guide</h3>

To a develop a custom plugin it is probably easiest to look at the other rainbow gum modules.
An important concept with extensions are the registries which allow you to register
a provider with a URI scheme.

<ol>
  <li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogPublisherRegistry}</li>
  <li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEncoderRegistry}</li>
  <li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogOutputRegistry}</li>
</ol>
{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogConfig} contains all the registries
and a special generic registry: {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.ServiceRegistry}.
The service registry is allows other plugins to share components.
To access these registries at configuration time as a plugin is to implement
a {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.spi.RainbowGumServiceProvider.Configurator}.

<p>
Next one should construct builders that are properties friendly to create the components
so that programmatic configuration users can use your extension. Rainbow Gum provides
an annotation processor that helps create builders
{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.annotation/}.

{@snippet lang=xml :
  <properties>
      <rainbowgum.version>_VERSION_</rainbowgum.version>
  </properties>
  ...
  <dependencies>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>io.jstach.rainbowgum</groupId>
          <artifactId>rainbowgum-core</artifactId>
          <version>${rainbowgum.version}</version>
          <scope>compile</scope>
      </dependency>
      <!-- This is the annotation processor -->
      <dependency>
          <groupId>io.jstach.rainbowgum</groupId>
          <artifactId>rainbowgum-apt</artifactId>
          <version>${rainbowgum.version}</version>
          <!-- the following maven config is important as the annotation processor should never be a transitive dep -->
          <scope>provided</scope>
          <optional>true</optional>
      </dependency>
  </dependencies>
}

Once the annotation processor is enabled one can create a properties aware builder with a
single static factory method annotated with {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.annotation.LogConfigurable}.
